# LUQ: Learning Uncertain Quantities
`LUQ` is a|Python package that provides simple implementations of the algorithms for learning uncertain quantities.
`LUQ` utilizes several publicly available Python packages that are commonly used for scientific computing (`NumPy` and `SciPy`) and machine learning (`scikit-learn`).
The package provides a simple end-to-end workflow going from raw time series data to QoI which can be used for data-consistent inversion.
